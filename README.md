# Credit Risk Analysis
### Overview <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this excercise is to predict credit risk through building and evaluating a dataset. Using machine learning algorithms, we are able to predict credit risk, monitor accounts, and provide sound recommenations to finantial institutions. Including any potential fraud liabilities. In this challenge, we were able to apply:<br>
* Machine Learning models<br>
* Utilize resampling to possibly address class imbalance<br>
* Identify the results of the machine learning models<br><br>
### Results<br>

### Summary <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have seen how the different models react with the data, It is best to continue with the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost as the results are accurate with the Precision, Recall, and F1 scores. It performs the best, compaired to the others and would prodect the institutions against any falks-positives.
